# THREE.VRControls as a module

I didn't like any of the existing solutions I could find for using VRControls in a modular js build. So I made this.

```javascript
import VRControls from 'three-vrcontrols-module';
const controls = new VRControls(camera);
```

Converted from: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/controls/VRControls.js

Currently up to date with THREE r84
