# THREE.VRControls as a module

I didn't any of the existing solutions I could find to use VRControls in a modular webpack build. So I made this.

```
import VRControls from 'three-vrcontrols-module';
```

Converted from: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/controls/VRControls.js

Current up to date with THREE r84
